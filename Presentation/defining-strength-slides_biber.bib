  ABSTRACT = {Quantum key growing, often called quantum cryptography or quantum key distribution, is a method using some properties of quantum mechanics to create a secret shared cryptography key even if an eavesdropper has access to unlimited computational power. A vital but often neglected part of the method is unconditionally secure message authentication. This thesis examines the security aspects of authentication in quantum key growing. Important concepts are formalized as Python program source code, a comparison between quantum key growing and a classical system using trusted couriers is included, and the chain rule of entropy is generalized to any Rényi entropy. Finally and most importantly, a security flaw is identified which makes the probability to eavesdrop on the system undetected approach unity as the system is in use for a long time, and a solution to this problem is provided.},

  ABSTRACT = {Password meters tell users whether their passwords are ``weak'' or ``strong.'' We performed a laboratory experiment to examine whether these meters influenced users' password selections when they were forced to change their real passwords, and when they were not told that their passwords were the subject of a study. We observed that the presence of meters yielded significantly stronger passwords. We performed a followup field experiment to test a different scenario: creating a password for an unimportant account. In this scenario, we found that the meters made no observable difference: participants simply reused weak passwords that they used to protect similar low-risk accounts. We conclude that meters result in stronger passwords when users are forced to change existing passwords on ``important'' accounts and that individual meter design decisions likely have a marginal impact.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper we will look at the distribution with which passwords are chosen. Zipf's Law is commonly observed in lists of chosen words. Using password lists from four different on-line sources, we will investigate if Zipf's law is a good candidate for describing the frequency with which passwords are chosen. We look at a number of standard statistics, used to measure the security of password distributions, and see if modelling the data using Zipf's Law produces good estimates of these statistics. We then look at the the similarity of the password distributions from each of our sources, using guessing as a metric. This shows that these distributions provide effective tools for cracking passwords. Finally, we will show how to shape the distribution of passwords in use, by occasionally asking users to choose a different password.},

  ABSTRACT = {Human-memorable passwords are a mainstay of computer security. To decrease vulnerability of passwords to brute-force dictionary attacks, many organizations enforce complicated password-creation rules and require that passwords include numerals and special characters. We demonstrate that as long as passwords remain human-memorable, they are vulnerable to ``smart-dictionary'' attacks even when the space of potential passwords is large. Our first insight is that the distribution of letters in easy-to-remember passwords is likely to be similar to the distribution of letters in the users' native language. Using standard Markov modeling techniques from natural language processing, this can be used to dramatically reduce the size of the password space to be searched. Our second contribution is an algorithm for efficient enumeration of the remaining password space. This allows application of time-space tradeoff techniques, limiting memory accesses to a relatively small table of ``partial dictionary'' sizes and enabling a very fast dictionary attack.We evaluated our method on a database of real-world user password hashes. Our algorithm successfully recovered 67.6\% of the passwords using a 2 x 109 search space. This is a much higher percentage than Oechslin's ``rainbow" attack'', which is the fastest currently known technique for searching large keyspaces. These results call into question viability of human-memorable character-sequence passwords as an authentication mechanism.},

  ABSTRACT = {Choosing the most effective word-mangling rules to use when performing a dictionary-based password cracking attack can be a difficult task. In this paper we discuss a new method that generates password structures in highest probability order. We first automatically create a probabilistic context-free grammar based upon a training set of previously disclosed passwords. This grammar then allows us to generate word-mangling rules, and from them, password guesses to be used in password cracking. We will also show that this approach seems to provide a more effective way to crack passwords as compared to traditional methods by testing our tools and techniques on real password sets. In one series of experiments, training on a set of disclosed passwords, our approach was able to crack 28\% to 129\% more passwords than John the Ripper, a publicly available standard password cracking program.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this paper we attempt to determine the effectiveness of using entropy, as defined in NIST SP800-63, as a measurement of the security provided by various password creation policies. This is accomplished by modeling the success rate of current password cracking techniques against real user passwords. These data sets were collected from several different websites, the largest one containing over 32 million passwords. This focus on actual attack methodologies and real user passwords quite possibly makes this one of the largest studies on password security to date. In addition we examine what these results mean for standard password creation policies, such as minimum password length, and character set requirements.},
